				<h4>Great Plains General Business Index</h4>
				<p>The Great Plains General Business Index was a quarterly publication tracking the regional economy in southwest &amp; west central Oklahoma.  Not only was a regional index created, but also thirteen additional indices were created for each of the thirteen counties comprising the region.  Although the Great Plains General Business Index is no longer published, we will maintain the four most recent publications on the site.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="docs/gpgbi1qtr2001.pdf">First Qtr 2001</a></li>
					<li><a href="docs/gpgbi2qtr2001.pdf">Second Qtr 2001</a></li>
					<li><a href="docs/Spring2002.pdf">Spring, 2002</a></li>
					<li><a href="docs/Summer2002.pdf">Summer, 2002</a></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4><a href="docs/resource_manual.pdf">Great Plains Resource Manual</a></h4>
				<p>Statistics from several state and federal government agencies have been compiled into one location in the Great Plains Resource Manual. The consolidated demographic information is intended to provide community leaders, business owners and the citizens of southwest &amp; west central Oklahoma a one-stop location for most of their statistical needs.  Business owners can use the information contained within the Great Plains Resource Manual to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>develop marketing plans,</li>
					<li>develop business plans,</li>
					<li>target a new market, etc</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Community leaders can use the demographic information to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>write grant proposals,</li>
					<li>understand the demographic trend of their community,</li>
					<li>plan for the future needs of the community's citizens, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The statistics covered in the resource manual include population, employment, income, earnings, taxable sales, educational attainment, births &amp; deaths, crime, vehicle registrations, and agriculture.</p>
				<p>The counties covered in the resource manual are Beckham, Blaine, Caddo, Custer, Dewey, Ellis, Greer, Harmon, Jackson, Kiowa, Roger Mills, Tillman, and Washita counties.</p>
				
				<h4><a href="docs/resource_directory.pdf">Great Plains Resource Directory</a></h4>
				<p>Most resource directories provide only a list of organizations that can help business people and community leaders with their issues and problems. However, the problem with just providing a list of organizations is knowing which organization can provide assistance with a specific problem. Our resource directory begins with a question/problem faced by business owners or community leaders, and then provides information for that question and then directs the individual to a resource organization that can provide additional help.</p>
				<p>Business people can find assistance with business plans, financing, taxes, regulations, marketing, etc. in the Great Plains Resource Directory.</p>
				<p>Community leaders can find assistance with strategic planning, leadership development, workforce development, etc. in the directory.</p>

				<h4>Oklahoma Trade Pull Factors</h4>
				<p>Trade pull factors relate a county's or city's ability to attract both resident and non-resident retail shoppers to its community through retail trade. For our most recently released newsletter reporting Oklahoma trade pull factors, see our homepage; (link to the CEBD&rsquo;s homepage) otherwise, check out some of our previously released trade pull factor newsletters posted below. The 1999 article was published by the Oklahoma Business Bulletin in 2000.</p>

				<h4>Labor Force Surveys</h4>
				<p>The following labor force surveys provide an indication of the underemployment in several communities in west central Oklahoma. Underemployment occurs whenever:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a worker is employed but is not utilizing his/her educational background in their current employment, or</li>
					<li>a worker is employed part-time but is seeking full-time employment.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Unlike unemployment, underemployment is not a regularly reported statistic, but it does provide a slightly different indication as to the size of a community's labor potential.</p>
