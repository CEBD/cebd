				<h1>Glossary</h1>
			    <p><strong>CIP (Classification of Instructional Programs)</strong> &ndash; A standard  numerical code for a post-secondary course of study, developed and defined by  the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s National   Center for Education  Statistics.</p>
		        <p><strong>Competency</strong> &ndash; A specific area of knowledge, skills, or  abilities in the O*NET framework.&nbsp; For  example, a competency may be academic (mathematical knowledge), practical  (mathematical program-solving skills), or physical/cognitive (number facility,  mathematical reasoning).</p>
		        <p><strong>Completions </strong>&ndash; The number of students in a given year that  completed a specific course of study.</p>
		        <p><strong>Earnings per Worker (Industry)</strong> &ndash; Total yearly earnings of a  regional industry (wages, salaries, profits, benefits, and other compensation)  divided by the number of jobs in the industry.</p>
		        <p><strong>Earnings per Worker (Occupation)</strong> &ndash; By default, shown as  median hourly earnings (wage/salary) of workers in that occupation.</p>
		        <p><strong>Growth Period</strong> &ndash; A timeframe defined by a start and an end  year.&nbsp; In this report, published data is  employed for each year in the growth period it is available.&nbsp; For future years (and sometimes the year  previous to the present) EMSI projections are used.</p>
		        <p><strong>Industrial Mix Effect</strong> &ndash; See Shift Share.</p>
		        <p><strong>Industry</strong> &ndash; A group of businesses that produce similar goods  and services, and share similar production processes for creating the goods and  services they sell.&nbsp; Industries are  classified using NAICS codes.&nbsp; Note that  in the NAICS system, what a business produces is given less importance than the  process used to create it.</p>
		        <p><strong>Industry Cluster</strong> &ndash; A group of industries closely connected  by supply chains and/or similar labor pools.</p>
		        <p><strong>Input-Output Models</strong> &ndash; A mathematical representation of the  economic relationships among all industries, especially with reference to how  much each industry purchases from each other industry.</p>
		        <p><strong>Inverse Staffing Pattern</strong> &ndash; A table of percentages that  shows, on average, how occupations are divided up among industries.&nbsp; For example, a (simplified) inverse staffing  pattern for registered nurses may show that 70% of RNs are employed by  hospitals, 10% by local government (i.e., public schools), 10% by nursing  homes, and 10% by offices of physicians.</p>
		        <p><strong>Jobs</strong> &ndash; This column in the data represents full and part-time  jobs, which can explain some situations in which the number of jobs in a region  seems unusually high compared to the total regional population.&nbsp; Unlike individual government sources, EMSI&rsquo;s  data includes jobs held by nearly all types of workers: payroll workers (who  have unemployment insurance), farm workers, railroad workers, military workers,  and sole proprietors.</p>
		        <p><strong>Job Zone</strong> &ndash; A measure of how much education and/or training  is required by an occupation, from Job Zone 1 (little or no preparation) to Job  Zone 5 (extensive preparation needed).</p>
		        <p><strong>Location Quotient (LQ)</strong> &ndash; A way of comparing a region to a  larger reference region according to some characteristic or asset.&nbsp; Suppose X is the amount of some asset in a  region (e.g., manufacturing jobs), and Y is the total amount of assets of  comparable types in the region (e.g., all jobs).&nbsp; X/Y is then the regional concentration of  that asset in the region.&nbsp; If X&rsquo; and Y&rsquo;  are similar data points for some larger reference region (like a state or nation),  then the LQ or relative concentration of that asset in the region compared to  the nation is (X/Y) / (X&rsquo;/Y&rsquo;).&nbsp; </p>
		        <p><strong>Multiplier</strong> &ndash; A number showing how changes (jobs, earnings,  or sales) in one industry will propagate to other industries in a regional  economy.&nbsp; For example, a jobs multiplier  of 3 for an industry means that a change of 100 jobs in that industry would  lead to a total change of 3*100 = 300 jobs in the whole economy.&nbsp; Note that this 300 includes the original 100  jobs, meaning the additional change is 200.</p>
		        <p><strong>NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)</strong> &ndash; A  system of classifying North American industries using six-digit codes.</p>
		        <p><strong>O*NET</strong> &ndash; A national database quantifying the competencies  (knowledge, skills, and abilities) required by over 800 occupation types.</p>
		        <p><strong>Occupation</strong> &ndash; A worker job description that contains a  defined set of tasks and responsibilities.&nbsp;  Occupations are classified using SOC codes (and O*NET extensions to  SOC).</p>
		        <p><strong>Occupational Compatibility Index</strong> &ndash; This number is intended  to score the compatibility of two occupations in terms of the knowledge,  skills, and abilities they require: a score of 100 means complete  compatibility, while a score of 0 means no compatibility.&nbsp; It is an artificial number created by EMSI&rsquo;s  proprietary algorithm and O*NET data.</p>
		        <p><strong>OES (Occupational Employment Statistics)</strong> &ndash; A federal data  source produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
		        <p><strong>Program </strong>&ndash; A post-secondary course of study (or group of  related courses) as defined by a standard CIP code.</p>
		        <p><strong>Projection</strong> &ndash; A method of trending past population numbers by  demographic group into the future.</p>
		        <p><strong>Requirements (Industry or Cluster)</strong> &ndash; The dollar amount of  goods or services that one industry or industry cluster needs to purchase from  another industry.</p>
		        <p><strong>Replacement Jobs</strong> &ndash; The number of job openings (over a given  timeframe) expected in an occupation as the result of turnover &ndash; e.g.,  employees changing occupations, retiring, etc.&nbsp;  It is derived by multiplying estimated annual turnover by the number of  years in the given timeframe.</p>
		        <p><strong>Shift Share</strong> &ndash; A standard method of regional economic  analysis that attempts to separate regional job growth into its component  causes.&nbsp; The three main causes identified  are the &ldquo;national growth effect,&rdquo; which is regional growth that can be  attributed to the overall growth of the entire U.S. economy; the &ldquo;industrial  mix effect,&rdquo; which is regional growth that can be attributed to positive trends  in the specific industry or occupation at a national level; and the &ldquo;regional  competitiveness effect,&rdquo; which is growth that cannot be explained by either  overall or industry/occupation-specific trends.&nbsp;  Shift share can be applied to job decline as well as job growth.</p>
		        <p><strong>SOC (Standard Occupation Classification)</strong> &ndash; The system of  classifying occupations that uses six-digit codes.</p>
		        <p><strong>Staffing Pattern</strong> &ndash; A way of showing what percentage of jobs  in a given industry are in a specific occupation.&nbsp; For example, a (simplified) staffing pattern  for the industry &ldquo;Hospitals&rdquo; might show that 10% of jobs in the hospital  industry are occupied by surgeons, 15% by general practitioners, 20% by nurses,  5 % by information technology support staff, 5% by janitors, 1% by chief  executives, and so on.&nbsp; We use  regionalized staffing patterns that are available by OES region.</p>
