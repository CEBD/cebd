              <h1>Southwestern Oklahoma Impact Coalition</h1>
              
              <p align="center"><strong>National Experts Say Improving Quaility of Place is Key to Attracting Workers to SW Oklahoma</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.soiconline.org"><img src="images/soic_logo.gif" alt="SOIC Logo" name="soic_logo" width="125" height="102" border="0" id="soic_logo" /></a>Conference attendees at the recent Southwest Oklahoma Impact  Coalition&rsquo;s (SOIC) 3rd annual conference were told by workforce experts  that oftentimes rural areas are not even on the radar of site location  consultants due to perceptions about the quantity and quality of the  existing workforce.</p>
              <p>Held at Quartz Mountain Resort and Conference Center, the  conference&rsquo;s focus was on understanding and addressing the impending  workforce crisis due to population losses and the large number of  retiring Baby Boomers.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is a timely issue as significant numbers of  businesses and companies are struggling to find the skilled workforce  they need in order to grow and expand in southwest Oklahoma,&rdquo; said  SWOSU President Dr. John Hays, SOIC board chair and president.</p>
              <p>Conference speakers included Dr. Kenneth E. Poole, CEO, Center for  Regional Economic Competitiveness and Executive Director, Council for  Community and Economic Research based in Arlington, Virginia; and Tom  Stellman, president and CEO of TIP Strategies in Austin, Texas.&nbsp; Both Poole and Stellman are known nationally for their work involving strategic planning for economic development agencies.</p>
              <p>Other speakers at the event were Dr. Tom Boyd, O.U. philosophy  professor emeritus; Oklahoma Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins; Natalie  Shirley, Oklahoma Department of Commerce executive director and  Oklahoma Secretary of Commerce and Tourism; Gary Ridley, executive  director, Oklahoma Department of Transportation; and Neal McCaleb,  former Oklahoma Secretary of Transportation.</p>
              <p>Stellman stressed the importance of economic and community  development entities focusing on the primary goal of improving the  quality of their communities as a means to address worker shortages.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Increasingly, young workers now find the place they want to live  and then find a job &ndash; just the reverse of how job decisions were made  in the past,&rdquo; Stellman said.</p>
              <p>Between 2006 and 2011, the 20-county SOIC region is expected to grow more slowly than Oklahoma and the United States on average.&nbsp;  It is predicted that that the region will lose about 5,000 young adults  ages 20-24 to net out-migration as these age groups move to urban areas.&nbsp; The region is also expected to add about 8,200 people aged 60 and above over the next five years.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Given the current demographic trends, southwest Oklahoma will  definitely have a declining labor pool therefore creating an even  greater sense of urgency for workforce development initiatives by both  the public and private sector,&rdquo; Poole said.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Poole also indicated that education providers must understand the  critical role of technical skills, life skills and soft skills in  preparing their students to enter the workforce, regardless of vocation.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Educators must teach toward a comprehensive skill set that will help ensure economic prosperity,&rdquo; said Poole.&nbsp;  &ldquo;In addition to research and learning skills, workers of tomorrow must  also have the innovation, civic and social skills that are not  traditionally taught at the P-20 level.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Lt. Governor Jari Askins commended SOIC for undertaking the  difficult task of bringing policy makers from the large geographic area  together to collaborate on the issues of workforce development and  transportation infrastructure.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Regional approaches to community and economic development must be  the priority of both the public and private sector if rural areas are  to reverse the trend of population losses,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;  &ldquo;The fact that our military installations are expected to grow  significantly will have a tremendous benefit to southwest Oklahoma both  in terms of population gain and talent recruitment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

          <img id="cebd_logo" src="images/cebd_logo.gif" alt="CEBD Logo" />
          <p>Economic impact analysis answers "what if" questions about the economy. For example, what would be the impact upon Oklahoma if Tinker AFB were closed in a new round of base closures?</p>
          <p>Our most recent economic impact study, <a href="docs/oklahoma_aed_program.pdf">The Economic Impact of the Oklahoma Agriculture Enhancement &amp; Diversification (AED) Program and the Cooperatives &amp; that it Supports</a> (December, 2003), highlights the employment, income, output, tax and population impacts that the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture's (<a href="http://www.state.ok.us/~okag/">ODA</a>) <a href="http://www.state.ok.us/~okag/mktdev-loanshome.htm">AED program</a> has upon the <a href="http://www.youroklahoma.com/">state of Oklahoma</a>.</p>
          <p>Another economic impact study that the center has completed, <a href="docs/oklahoma_arts_council.pdf">The Economic Impacts of the Arts in Oklahoma</a>, reported the combined impacts of the Oklahoma Arts Council and Arts organizations and events supported by the Oklahoma Arts Council.
