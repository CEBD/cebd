      <h1>HUB Zone: Historically Underutilized Business Zone Program</h1>
      <ul id="tagline">
        <li>October, 2003</li>
        <li>by: Lisa Rockett</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The HUB Zone program provides federal contracting assistance for qualified
        small business concerns located in historically underutilized business
        zones (HUB Zones). The law was created in an effort to increase employment
        opportunities, investment, and economic development in those areas, long
        neglected as potential business sites. The law requires that 3 percent
        of all federal contract funding be directed towards a HUB Zone certified
        business. Although the percentage seems small, this equals $6 billion
        in set aside monies going toward HUB Zone Small Business.</p>
      <p>The HUB Zone Empowerment Contracting program was enacted into law as
        part of the Small Business Re-authorization Act of 1997. The program
        falls under the auspices of the U.S. Small Business Administration. The
        program encourages economic development in historically underutilized
        business zones -'B Zones'- through the establishment of preferences.</p>
      <p>SBA's HUB Zone program is in line with the efforts of both the Administration
        and Congress to promote economic development and employment growth in
        distressed areas by providing access to more Federal contracting opportunities.</p>
      <p>To be eligible for the HUB Zone program and become a certified HUB Zone
        small business, a company must be a small business owned and controlled
        by U.S. citizens. The principal office must be located in a HUB Zone,
        and at least 35 percent of its employees must live in a HUB Zone. To
        be considered a resident of a HUB Zone, the employee must either have
        registered to vote in the HUB Zone or lived there for at least 180 days.
        The Small Business Administration (SBA) has decided that only full-time
        employees who work at least 30 hours per week are eligible.</p>
      <p>To become a HUB Zone small business, the owner(s) must apply to the
        SBA for certification. If granted, the SBA will add the business to the
        list of certified HUB Zone small businesses. The SBA maintains a listing
        of qualified HUB Zone small businesses that Federal agencies can us to
        locate vendors.</p>
      <p>There are four types of HUB Zone contracting opportunities:</p>
      <p>Competitive: Contracts can be set-aside for HUB Zone competition when
        the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that at least two
        qualified HUB Zone small businesses will submit offers and that the contract
        will be awarded at a fair market price.</p>
      <p>Sole Source: HUB Zone contracts can be awarded if the contracting officer
        determines that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>only one qualified HUB Zone small business is responsible to perform
          the contract,</li>
        <li>two or more qualified HUB Zone small businesses are not likely to
          submit offers and</li>
        <li>the anticipated award price of the proposed contract will not exceed
          $5 million for manufacturing requirements and $3 million for all other
          requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Full &amp; Open: Competitive contracts can be awarded with a price
        evaluation preference. The offer of the HUB Zone small business must
        not be 10 percent higher than the offer of a non-small business.</p>
      <p> Subcontracting: All subcontracting plans for large business Federal
        contractors must include a HUB Zone subcontracting goal.</p>
      <p> To be awarded contracts under the program, your firm must first meet
        HUB Zone eligibility requirements, be certified by the U.S. Small Business
        Administration (SBA) as a qualified HUB Zone small business, and be listed
        on SBA's 'List of Qualified HUB Zone Small Business Concerns' and in
        SBA's PRO-Net database. For SBA to certify your firm, they must analyze
        some factual information about it. They have developed an electronic
        application form for you to use. You can access the electronic application
        on their web-site www.sba.gov/hubzone.</p>

        Economically Distressed Areas in Western Oklahoma". If you have any questions,
